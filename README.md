# 448Delta
448Delta was NetworkDLS's first viable commercial product. It was discontinued over internal discontent with code quality. It is presented here for educational and nostalgic purposes.

Because of the unconventional registry operations performed by the install process, we HIGHLY recommend that you only run this application on "throw-away" virtual machines.

Registration code: SDoIG-vU3IX-IWoVF-YKMZL

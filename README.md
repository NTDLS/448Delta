# 448Delta
448Delta was NetworkDLS's first viable commercial product. It was discontinued over internal discontent with code quality (I mean, the code is all in the headers.... ffs). It is presented here for educational and nostalgic purposes.

üóÉÔ∏è Keep in kind that this is a legacy utility, originally designed for Windows 95/98 and 2000 and is archived here for acedemic and historical purposes.

Because of the unconventional registry operations performed by the install process, we HIGHLY recommend that you only run this application on "throw-away" virtual machines.

Registration code: SDoIG-vU3IX-IWoVF-YKMZL

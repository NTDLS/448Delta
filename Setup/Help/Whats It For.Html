<P>448Delta is for those who have sensitive data and would like to keep
it away from the curious, or for those who would like to archive data or
pack many files into one package without using as much diskspace. 448Delta
can secure data stored on a &quot;F16, F32 or NTFS&quot; file system making
448Delta capable of securing files of virtually any type. </P>

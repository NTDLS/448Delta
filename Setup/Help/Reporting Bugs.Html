<P>448Delta has been tested on Windows 98, Me, NT 4.0, &amp; W2k.</P>

448delta, therefore 448delta will not run on a windows 95 platform.</P>

found have been fixed. If 448Delta crashes and gives you an error, The
error message should be followed by an error code (Error: xx). Please send
the error code, a detailed description of what you were doing when the
error occurred, what operating system you are using to: <A HREF="mailto:Tech@NetWorkDLS.Com">Tech@NetWorkDLS.Com</A>.

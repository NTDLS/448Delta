<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>448Delta Encryption Algorithm 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H3>

<CENTER><P>448Delta Uses A Highly Modified 448-Bit BlowFish Algorithm</P></CENTER>

<P>Blowfish is a block cipher encryption algorithm that encrypts data in
8-byte blocks. The algorithm consists of two parts: A key-expansion part
and a data-encryption part.</P>

<P>Key expansion converts a variable-length key of at most 56 bytes (448
bits) into several subkey arrays totaling 4168 bytes.</P>

<P>Blowfish has 16 rounds. Each round consists of a key-dependent permutation,
a key and data-dependent substitution. All operations are XORs and additions
on 32-bit words. The only additional operations are four indexed array
data lookups per round.</P>

<P>No one has come close to developing an attack that breaks Blowfish.</P>

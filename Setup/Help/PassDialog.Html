or folders you want to encrypt. The two empty text boxes are where you type the
passwords you want to encrypt the file with. The password must be at least
8 characters and no more than 56 characters. The password strength status
on this dialog tells you how strong the length of your password is, normally the
longer the password the safer the data.</P>

on top&quot; check box.</P>

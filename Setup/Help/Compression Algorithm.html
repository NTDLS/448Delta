<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>448Delta Compression Algorithm
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H3>

<P>448Delta compression significantly reduces the size of your files and
folders while you are encrypting. The algorithm consists of two parts:
A &quot;Multiple Binary Tree&quot; search and a &quot;Arithmetic Compression&quot;
search. This algorithm was developed by NetWorkDLS and was designed to
be fairly fast and deliver reasonable compression. The key to the compression
is in the fact that is doesn't waist time looking for minuscule compression
opportunities.</P>

<P>448Delta supports data compression... This means that when you encrypt
or pack files they actually become smaller than they were before you encrypted
them. 448Delta Data Compression is Off by default. To activate 448Delta
Data Compression: when you are encryping and 448Delta prompts you for a
password, check the box beside &quot;Compress Data&quot;.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>(1) 448Delta Data Compression works on all type of files, Though you
will find that the compression ratio is much greater on text files.</LI>

<LI>(3) 448Delta Data Compression is NOT compatible with WinZip.</LI>

<LI>(4) Windows NT &amp; 2000 will report that a file compressed by 448Delta
is not compressed. This is because 448Delta does not interact with Windows
NT &amp; 2000 built in compression methods. In most cases 448Delta compresses
beyond the capabilities of Windows NT &amp; 2000.</LI>
